      "Description: Theory that life in general is meaningless\n",
      "Extract: Absurdism is the philosophical theory that the universe is irrational and meaningless. It states that trying to find meaning leads people into a conflict with the world. This conflict can be between rational man and an irrational universe, between intention and outcome, or between subjective assessment and objective worth, but the precise definition of the term is disputed. Absurdism claims that the world as a whole is absurd. It differs in this regard from the less global thesis that some particular situations, persons, or phases in life are absurd.\n"

      "{{defn|Any system of thought that denies the causal nexus and maintains that events succeed one another haphazardly or by chance (not in the mathematical but in the popular sense). In {{gli|metaphysics}}, accidentalism denies the doctrine that everything occurs or results from a definite cause. In this connection it is synonymous with {{gli|tychism}} (ruxi, chance), a term used by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] for the theories that make chance an objective factor in the process of the Universe.}}\n",

      "{{defn|The philosophy that denies the reality of the [[Universe]], seeing it as ultimately illusory, and only the infinite Unmanifest Absolute as real. In contrast to {{gli|pantheism}}, acosmism begins with the recognition that there is only one Reality, which is infinite, non-dual, blissful, etc. Yet the phenomenal reality of which humans are normally aware is none of these things; it is in fact just the opposite—i.e., dualistic, finite, full of suffering and pain, and so on. And since the Absolute is the only reality, that means that everything that is not Absolute cannot be real. Thus, according to this viewpoint, the phenomenal dualistic world is ultimately an illusion (\"Maya\" to use the technical Indian term), irrespective of the apparent reality it possesses at the mundane or empirical level.}}\n",

      "{{defn|A loosely defined movement in [[art]] and [[literature]] popular in late 19th-century Britain which held that art does not have any didactic purpose (it need only be beautiful), and that life should imitate art. The main characteristics of the movement were suggestion rather than statement, sensuality, massive use of symbols, and synaesthetic effects – that is, correspondence between words, colors, and music.}}\n",

Due to definitional variance, an agnostic atheist does not believe in [[god]] or gods and by extension holds true that \"the existence and nonexistence of deities is currently unknown and may be absolutely unknowable\", or that \"knowledge of the existence and nonexistence of deities is irrelevant or unimportant\", or that \"abstention from claims of knowledge of the existence and nonexistence of deities is optimal\".

Agnosticism itself, in both its strong (explicit) and weak (implicit) forms, is necessarily neither an {{gli|atheism|atheist}} nor a {{gli|theism|theist}} position, though an agnostic person may also be either an atheist, a theist, or one who endorses neither position.}}\n",

It sees the only just basis for [[law]] as arising from [[private property]] norms and an unlimited right of [[contract]] between sovereign individuals. From this basis, anarcho-capitalism rejects the [[State (polity)|state]] as an unjustified monopolist and aggressor against sovereign individuals, and embraces [[anti-statist]] ''[[laissez-faire]]'' {{gli|capitalism}}. Anarcho-capitalists would aim to protect [[individual liberty]] and [[property]] by replacing a government monopoly, which is involuntarily funded through taxation, with private, competing businesses.}}\n",

This includes [[Aristotle]]'s view of the relation of soul and body held also by the [[stoics]] and [[scholastics]]. On the other hand, [[monadology]] ([[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]) has also been described as animistic. The name is most commonly applied to [[vitalism]], which makes life, or life and mind, the directive principle in evolution and growth, holding that life is not merely mechanical but that there is a directive force that guides energy without altering its amount. An entirely different class of ideas, also termed animistic, is the belief in the \"[[Anima mundi|world soul]]\", held by [[Plato]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and others. Lastly, in discussions of religion, \"animism\" refers to the belief in indwelling souls or spirits, particularly so-called \"primitive\" religions that consider everything inhabited by spirits.}}\n",

      "{{defn|A form of [[personification]] involving the attribution of human characteristics and qualities to non-human beings, objects, or natural phenomena. Animals, forces of nature, and unseen or unknown authors of chance are frequent subjects of anthropomorphosis. Two examples are the attribution of a human body or of human qualities generally to god (or the gods), and creating imaginary persons who are the embodiment of an abstraction such as Death, Lust, War, or the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]].

Antinomianism is the polar opposite of [[legalism (theology)|legalism]], the notion that obedience to a code of religious law is necessary for [[salvation]].
